- `firechain zkEVM` is a new zk-rollup that provides Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) equivalence (opcode-level compatibility) for a transparent user experience and existing Ethereum ecosystem and tooling compatibility.
- It consists on a decentralized Ethereum Layer 2 scalability solution utilising cryptographic zero-knowledge technology to provide validation and fast finality of off-chain transaction computations.
- This approach required the recreation of all EVM opcodes for transparent deployment and transactions with existing Ethereum smart contracts. For this purpose a new set of tools and technologies were created and engineered and are contained in this organization.
